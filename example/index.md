# WSSG, the Worst Static Site Generator.

Welcome to the example site for WSSG, the Worst Static Site Generator.
Relies on RegEx for parsing lines?
Check.
Supports an incredibly small subset of markdown?
Check.
Doesn't allow for nested markdown expressions/state?
Check.

If you're feeling masochistic enough to use this instead of something sane like Hugo or Jekyll, place `wssg.py` somewhere permanent and add a bash alias for it (mine is `alias wssg="python3 $HOME/Programs/wssg.py").

For a more fleshed out example of the wonders this can perform, check out my personal website at [joshuaoreilly.com](joshuaoreilly.com).
